## Motivation

TaqMDA is an R script developed to analyze large scale data obtained by RT-QPCR arrays. It generates a principal component analysis for the first 3 dimensions and a heatmap.

Developed for the study: *...*

## Principle

TaqMDA.R is a simple R script which analyzes QPCR values from a CSV file (see example in *data/* directory).

For each qPCR target, if more than N % (defined by the user) of the values are undetermined, this will trigger its exclusion from the analysis. 

The lists of genes containing NA, eliminated and retained are written in a text file.

The remaining qPCR data are reduced, centered and classified by hierarchical cluster analysis.

A principal component analyze is performed with FactoMineR package and summarized by graphs and tables in both individual and variable spaces.

Finally, a distance matrix is generated by the Pearson method and subsequently used to create a heatmap scaled by individual sample thanks to gplots package.

## Get TaqMDA

* Download the program

With *git clone* from the repository
 
```	git clone https://github.com/a-slide/TaqMDA```

From the [zip archive](https://github.com/a-slide/TaqMDA/archive/master.zip) 

* Set the script to be executable

```	sudo chmod u+x TaqMDA.R```

* Add the executable to your system PATH

## Usage

**Format your tab separated csv data sheet as follow:**

```  
            qPCR1   qPCR2   qPCR3   ...
sample1-1   0.23    0       12334   ...
sample1-2   12      0       8755    ...
sample1-3   65      0       87545   ...
...         ...     ...     ...     ...
```
See example file in the repository data folder

* Replace non detected qPCR values by NA (if not already done)

* Define a percentage of autorized NA values per gene to be considered as valid

* Run the script with the data sheet and the percent of allowed NA values

```
    USAGE: TaqMDA.R  <Sample_sheet.csv>  <max_percent_of_na_authorized>
        * Filename of csv file containing the data
        * Max percentage of values with NA allows per column

    EXAMPLE : TaqMDA.R ./data/Sample.csv 50
```

All files will be generated in the current folder
